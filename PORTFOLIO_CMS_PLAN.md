# Portfolio CMS, Blog, Inbox, and Freelance Platform Plan

This document is the execution checklist for turning the current static portfolio into a secure, multilingual portfolio CMS using Next.js and Supabase. It is written so Claude Code can implement one task or milestone at a time without having to redesign the architecture during every session.

## 1. Project outcome

Build a zero-cost-first system that provides:

- A secure, private administration dashboard.
- Database-managed portfolio content in French, English, and Arabic.
- A contact inbox with message statuses and notes.
- A multilingual blog with drafts, previews, publishing, tags, and SEO.
- A freelance services page and a small lead-management pipeline.
- Secure image and document management.
- Fast public pages that remain responsive, accessible, SEO-friendly, and RTL-compatible.

## 2. Agreed technical direction

- Keep the existing Next.js 15 App Router application.
- Use a modular monolith; do not create a separate Express or NestJS service.
- Use Supabase Free for PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, and optional Edge Functions.
- Use Next.js Server Components for public reads.
- Use Server Actions or Route Handlers for validated writes.
- Use Supabase Row Level Security as the final authorization layer.
- Use Cloudflare Turnstile Free on public forms.
- Store editable content in normalized tables with separate translation tables.
- Keep interface labels in `messages/fr.json`, `messages/en.json`, and `messages/ar.json`.
- Store article bodies as Markdown and sanitize rendered HTML.
- Use locale-prefixed public URLs such as `/fr/blog/...`, `/en/blog/...`, and `/ar/blog/...`.
- Use static generation or caching with on-demand revalidation for public content.

## 3. Rules for Claude Code

Before starting any task:

- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md` and this plan completely.
- [ ] Inspect `git status` and preserve unrelated user changes.
- [ ] Work on one task ID or one milestone only unless the user explicitly expands scope.
- [ ] State which files will be modified before editing them.
- [ ] Do not create or change Supabase production resources without explicit permission.
- [ ] Never place a service-role key, Turnstile secret, or other secret in client code.
- [ ] Do not mark a task complete until its acceptance criteria pass.
- [ ] Run the relevant verification commands after implementation.
- [ ] Update the checkboxes in this plan and add a short entry to the Decision Log.

Recommended prompt for a new Claude session:

```text
Read CLAUDE.md and PORTFOLIO_CMS_PLAN.md. Implement task [TASK-ID] only.
Inspect the current worktree before editing and preserve unrelated changes.
Follow the task requirements, security rules, and acceptance criteria.
Run the required checks, update the task checkbox, and summarize changed files,
verification results, remaining manual steps, and any decisions made.
```

## 4. Global definition of done

Every implementation task must satisfy the applicable items below:

- [ ] TypeScript remains strict; no unjustified `any` types.
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes.
- [ ] `npm run build` passes.
- [ ] Relevant automated tests pass once a test runner exists.
- [ ] No secrets or real credentials are committed.
- [ ] Database changes are represented by versioned migrations.
- [ ] RLS is enabled and tested for every exposed table.
- [ ] Public, authenticated, and administrator access are tested separately.
- [ ] English, French, and Arabic UI messages remain synchronized.
- [ ] Arabic layout and RTL behavior are manually checked.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation, focus states, labels, errors, and reduced motion are checked.
- [ ] Mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts are checked.
- [ ] Loading, empty, success, and failure states are implemented.
- [ ] Relevant documentation and this checklist are updated.

## 5. Dependency and delivery map

```text
M0 Decisions
   -> M1 Engineering foundation
      -> M2 Database and RLS
         -> M3 Authentication and dashboard shell
            -> M4 Internationalized routing and SEO
               -> M5 Projects vertical slice
                  -> M6 Remaining portfolio CMS
            -> M7 Contact inbox
            -> M8 Blog publishing
            -> M9 Freelance leads
               -> M10 Hardening and quality
                  -> M11 Deployment and launch
```

After M3, the content, inbox, blog, and freelance modules can be developed in separate branches, but they should be integrated and verified one at a time.

## 6. Suggested six-sprint schedule

| Sprint | Focus | Exit result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | M0-M2 | Local Supabase, migrations, generated types, and tested RLS |
| 2 | M3-M4 | Secure dashboard shell and locale-prefixed public routes |
| 3 | M5-M6 | Projects and remaining portfolio content managed from dashboard |
| 4 | M7 and M9 | Contact inbox, protected forms, and freelance lead pipeline |
| 5 | M8 | Multilingual blog, editor, preview, publishing, and SEO |
| 6 | M10-M11 | Security review, accessibility, performance, deployment, and launch |

The sprint sequence matters more than the calendar dates. Do not migrate every content section before the Projects vertical slice is proven.
